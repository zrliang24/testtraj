\arguments{
\item{lat}{the starting latitude (in decimal
degrees) for the model run(s).}

\item{lon}{the starting longitude (in decimal
degrees) for the model run(s).}

\item{height}{the starting height (in meters above
ground level) for the model run(s).}

\item{duration}{the duration of each
model run (either forward or backward) in hours.}

\item{start_day}{the day that the model will
initialize and run. This should take the form of a
single-length vector for a day (\code{"YYYY-MM-DD"}).}

\item{start_hour}{a single daily hour as an
integer hour (from \code{0} to \code{23}).}

\item{direction}{an option to select whether to
conduct the model in the \code{forward} or
\code{backward} directions.}

\item{met_type}{an option to select meteorological
data files. The options are \code{gdas1} (Global Data
Assimilation System 1-degree resolution data) and
\code{reanalysis} (NCAR/NCEP global reanalysis data).}

\item{vert_motion}{a numbered option to
select the method used to simulation vertical
motion. The methods are: (0) input model data,
(1) isobaric, (2) isentropic, (3) constant density,
(4) isosigma, (5) from divergence, (6) remap MSL to
AGL, (7) average data, and (8) damped magnitude.}

\item{model_height}{the upper limit of the
model domain in meters.}

\item{particle_num}{the number of particles
released by source during each release cycle.}

\item{particle_max}{the number of particles
released by a source during a model run.}

\item{emissions}{the numbers corresponding to the
stored emissions presets. These presets are
specified using the function
\code{hysplit_dispersion_define("emissions")}.}

\item{species}{the numbers corresponding to the
stored species presets. These presets are specified
using the function
\code{hysplit_dispersion_define("species")}.}

\item{grids}{the numbers corresponding to the
stored grid presets. These presets are specified
using the function
\code{hysplit_dispersion_define("grids")}.}

\item{return_disp_df}{an option to return a data
frame with dispersion data.}

\item{write_disp_CSV}{an option to write disperison
data to a CSV file.}

\item{disp_name}{an optional, descriptive name for
the output file collection.}
}
\description{
The function executes single/multiple
forward or backward HYSPLIT dispersion runs using
specified meteorological datasets.

# Perform a dispersion run lasting 12 hours over
# two consecutive days, both starting at midnight;
# grid presets 1 and 2 will be used as sampling
